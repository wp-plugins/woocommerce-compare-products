Add a World Class Compare Products Feature to your WooCommerce store today with the WooCommerce Compare Products plugin..

== Description ==

The Compare Products extension for WooCommerce gives a product comparison feature that you'd only expect to find on the big corporate e-commerce sites. 

Compare Products uses your existing WooCommerce Product Categories and Product Attributes to create Product Feature Sets that can be assigned to each and every product to create a feature comparison table. 

This allows users to firstly add products to a compare widget basket, then at the click of a mouse the chosen products can be viewed in a state-of-the-art comparison table. 

Chosen products are compared side-by-side, feature by feature, price-by-price. Discard products from the table at the click of a mose as you hone in on the product that is the one for you. Save the comparison as a PDF or print it.

= Why We Built it! =

We love the Compare Products feature that the big e-commerce sites have. We have looked at them all and over 12 months have developed what we believe is a product comparison extension for WooCommerce that is better than any of them.

We distribute the plugin in 2 versions - This FREE lite version and an advanced featured Pro Version.  Today thousands of WooCommerce stores owners successfully use the Free lite version to provide the Product Comparison feature we love - to their customers.

= Support =

If you have any problem with setting up the Free lite version please post your support request here on the WordPress support forum. PLEASE if you have a problem DO NOT just give the plugin a bad star rating and review without first requesting support. Giving the plugin a bagging without affording us the opportunity to help solve the issue is in our opinion just incredibly unfair.

Once you have the plugin installed and activated please refer to the plugins comprehensive [Online Documentation](http://docs.a3rev.com/user-guides/woocommerce/compare-products/) and guide to setting up the Compare Products plugin on your WooCommerce store.If you have questions - agin please post them to the support forum here.

= PRO Version Upgrade =

* When you install WooCommerce Compare Products you will see all the added functionality that the PRO Version offers right there in the admin panel.
* The plugin is designed so that the upgrade is completely seamless. 
* When you upgrade nothing changes except all the features of Compare Products you see on the lite version are activated. 
* This means you can activate, set up and use the free version and then if you find you want the added features and functionality you can upgrade, completely risk free.  


= Pro Version Features =

* All of the In-Plugin Custom Style and layout settings are activated.
* Product Express Manager - worth the price of the Pro Version upgrade on its own - Saves you hours, days or even weeks of work on larger stores

== Changelog ==

= 2.1.4 - 2013/04/26 =
* Fixed: Text colour pickers not saving and displaying the hex number and hex colour in Font Colour, Font Link Colour and Font Hover colour selectors after editing and updating. The bug affected all font colour setting that use theme colours on install. These are the settings show an empty colour selector field on install.

= 2.1.3 - 2013/04/23 =
* Fixed: External / Affiliates link on Compare Window is now backward compatible from WooCommerce Version 2.0. Was showing fatal Error for older versions.

= 2.1.2 - 2013/04/17 =
* Feature: Added when install and activate plugin link redirects to WooCommerce Compare Products admin panel instead of the wp-plugins dashboard.
* Fixed: Compare Feature search, search term is no longer case sensitive.
* Fixed: Updated all JavaScript functions so that the plugin is compatible with jQuery Version1.9 and backwards to version 1.6. WordPress still uses jQuery version 1.8.3. In themes that use Google js Library instead of the WordPress jQuery then there was trouble because Google uses the latest jQuery version 1.9. There are a number of functions in jQuery Version 1.9 that have been depreciated and hence this was causing errors with the jQuery function in the plugin.

= 2.1.1 - 2013/04/10 =
* Fixed: Compare on screen widow not opening in IE9. Missed an _ in command and IE9 don't recognize space. Thanks to Nicola from yithemes.com for picking that up
