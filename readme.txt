== Description ==

WooCommerce Compare Products instantly adds the <strong>cutting edge Product Comparison feature</strong> to your WooCommerce store.

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8__ZFxKSRA] 

Compare Products uses your existing WooCommerce Product Categories and Product Attributes to create Product Feature 'Sets' that can be assigned to each and every product to create a feature comparison table. This allows users to firstly add products to a compare widget basket, where they can click a button and in an on-screen pop-up compare those products, feature by feature, price-by-price (if you show prices). Users can remove items from the comparison table as they narrow down their selections.   
 
= Key Features =

* Professional front end compare products presentation, buttons, links, sidebar compare basket widget and product comparison pop-up.
* Works with any Theme that has the WooCommerce plugin installed and activated.
* On install all of your existing Product Categories are auto created as Compare Categories including a Master Category (on the FREE Lite version only)
* On install all of your existing Product Attributes are auto created as Compare Features. Each Attribute's Terms are auto created as Feature values (the data that is compared)
* On the Free Lite version all Compare Features and their Values (Attributes and their Terms) are auto assigned to the Master Category. Upgrading to the Pro version activates the Compare Categories feature and allows you to set up Comparable Product sets. On the Free version there is only 1 Product Set - the Master Category. 
* Add custom Comparable Features and values independent of your Product Attributes and terms. Enables you to create any custom Product feature that you want users to be able to compare.

= Why We Built it! =

Personally I love the Compare Products feature that the big e-commerce sites have. It just makes sorting and selecting the product that is right for my needs so easy. Compare Products is a core function of the Magento platform. In our web development business we had clients continually asking for the feature on their e-commerce websites. Using WooCommerce as the e-Commerce platform for our clients work I looked and looked and could not find a Compare Products extension for WooCommerce. So we built it and used it in our client work and they loved it. After taking 200+ hours to build the Compare Products extension we realize why no other developer had ever done it. 

We distribute the plugin in 2 versions - This FREE lite version and an advanced featured Pro Version.  Today thousands of WooCommerce stores owners successfully use the Free lite version to provide the Product Comparison feature we love - to their customers.

= Support =

If you have any problem with setting up the Free lite version please post your support request here on the WordPress support forum. PLEASE if you have a problem DO NOT just give the plugin a bad star rating and review without first requesting support. Giving the plugin a bagging without affording us the opportunity to help solve the issue is in our opinion just incredibly unfair.

Once you have the plugin installed and activated please refer to the plugins comprehensive [Online Documentation](http://docs.a3rev.com/user-guides/woocommerce/compare-products/) and guide to setting up the Compare Products plugin on your WooCommerce store.If you have questions - agin please post them to the support forum here.

= PRO Version Upgrade =

When you install WooCommerce Compare Products you will see all the added functionality that the PRO Version offers. The plugin is designed so that the upgrade is completely seamless. Nothing changes except all the features of Compare Products you see on the lite version are activated. This means you can activate, set up and use the free version and then if you find you want the added features and functionality you can upgrade, completely risk free.  

<strong>Pro Version Features</strong> 

* Compare Categories - Use your existing Product Categories to create Product Comparison sets. Compare Categories creates a table of features that apply to a specific range of products that can be applied to those Products only. This means that when products within a Category set are compared users only see the table of features that apply to that group of products. On sites with a mixed product offering to create meaningful tables of Comparable feature sets, you need to have more than one category.
* Product Express Manager - Save hours (days on larger stores) in setting up your stores comparison features.  Categories are assigned to individual products and the feature set for that category then applies to all those products assigned to that category. Products Express Manager allows you to configure the Comparison feature for your entire store from the plugins Products tab.
* Product Comparison in a new window. The Pro version does not use a pop-up tool to show the Compare Products table like the Lite Version does - instead it uses the browser window. 
* Product Comparison window has 2 viewing options - open on screen (user does not leave the page) or open a full screen window in a new tab or new tab in a cell phone.
* Product Comparison Window in the Pro version features fixed scrolling. The Features being compared stay fixed whilst the products horizontally scroll under them.
* Product Comparison window features browser scroll. There is no inner table container with its own scroll.
* Advance Print Product Comparison function. Print the whole of the comparison table no mater how many features are being compared. (prints up to 3 Products). 

View these features on the [Pro Version Demo site here](http://store.a3dev.net/shop/) Add some products to the Compare basket and try the on-screen pop up window. It is a beautiful presentation.
